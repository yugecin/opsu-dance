#opsu!dance
[example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB7N9MhCvzg)  
  
fork of [opsu!](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu) with cursordancing auto.  
I make cursordancing video's -[example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oFH58X_lTY)-, but I have too many requests and this way I can give people the opportunity to just run it and see the result instead of waiting for me to make a video. Original bot is written in C# and videos are made on osu!, but I don't want to distribute that program, because I don't want to endorse cheating in any way. The sources found in this repo are very representative of the ones of my bot (most files are the exact same, except for C#/java changes).  
  
You can find general (run/build) instructions in the original [opsu! README](README-OPSU.md).

###Making videos
You can make videos under following conditions:

* You will wait a reasonable amount of time between making videos, making too much too fast means it won't be entertaining anymore.
* You will not deny you used opsu!dance to make your video
* You may provide a link to this repository. This is always very appreciated. Please do keep in mind I only made some adjustements/fixes and added the dancing stuff. opsu! was made by [@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu) (see credits below)
* Asking for beatmap requests is discouraged. After all, everyone can download this and see it for themselves.
* __YOU WILL NOT PRETEND LIKE YOU MADE/OWN THIS SOFTWARE__

###Credits
opsu! was made by Jeffrey Han ([@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu)). All game concepts and designs are based on work by osu! developer Dean Herbert. Other opsu! credits can be found [here](CREDITS.md).  
opsu!dance (everything in the src package yugecin.opsudance) was made by me ([@yugecin](https://github.com/yugecin)). Originally in C#, now ported to java. Some edits were made in the opsu! sources.
